# Analysis and Prediction of Used Car Prices
The dataset explored in this [project](https://github.com/y-alzahrani/used-car-prices-analysis/blob/main/used_car_prices_analysis.ipynb) contains over 90,000 entries of used car data scraped from the British market. The aims are to examine how different car features influence the car price, and to predict the car price.
